# IHN-FoodDrop-Automation
A platform that automates the delivery of rejected food loads to food banks.

A typical use case of our platform. 1) A truck driver with a  rejected food load wants to go from location A to location B. 2) They fill out a form in the online platform providing relevant details (see screenshot from our platform). 3) Our back end runs our dynamic fair allocation mechanism and matches the request to a food bank. 4) The representative of the matched food bank receives a notification on their phone, via SMS, through which they can access the information regarding the food load (see screenshot from our platform). 5) Once the food bank accepts the delivery, the truck driver is notified and given the contact information of the matched food bank, via SMS.
